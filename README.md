# 🥁 Drum Kit

An interactive web‑based drum kit that lets you play drum sounds by clicking on buttons or pressing corresponding keys on your keyboard.

---

## 📌 Description

This **Drum Kit** project demonstrates how to build an audio‑driven interface with vanilla JavaScript. It provides a set of drum pads that respond to mouse clicks and key presses, plays the appropriate drum sound, and shows a brief button animation to indicate which pad was activated.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎹 **Keyboard & Mouse Control**  
  Play drum sounds by clicking on the on‑screen pads or by pressing matching keys (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`).

- 🔊 **High‑Quality Drum Samples**  
  Includes a collection of `.mp3` and `.wav` files for snare, kick, toms, crash, and ride cymbals.

- ✨ **Visual Feedback**  
  Pads animate (e.g., a “pressed” effect) for better user interaction and timing feedback.

- 📱 **Responsive Design**  
  Layout adjusts for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
